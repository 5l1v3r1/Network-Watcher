netactview 0.6.4
--------------
 - Fixed processing of commands and process names with invalid utf-8 characters. 
   Some commands with bad utf-8 characters lead to an out of buffer read and 
   possibly a denial of service security vulnerability (segfault application 
   crash). No path for memory corruption or code execution was found. 
   To exploit the potential vulnerability an attacker needs to control an utf-8
   invalid sub-string in the command line of an application that uses network 
   resources (ex: non URI or invalid URI encoding file name).
 - Fixed configuration file validation to not allow huge configuration files.
   A configuration file with a GB scale filter would result in an application
   crash with memory corruption and possibly code execution. This had some small 
   potential to be exploited as a privilege authorization avoidance method to 
   get root from a sudo administrator at a netactview run with sudo/gksu, if the 
   attacker can already modify current sudo user configuration files. An attack
   may be practical only on high end servers.
 - Fixed the display of multiple multicast dns connections listening on the
   same port. If process information was not fully available some of the 
   connections with with identical protocol, addresses and ports would not be
   displayed. The fix makes all identical connections visible and uses 
   additional identification information (inode) that is more often usable than
   the process ID. There still remain some connection tracking issues that will
   be handled better in netactview 0.7 .
 - Fixed the connections list save when saving as root to a folder that the
   current sudo user can modify. The file was not saved with the sudo user as 
   owner in some cases.
 - Limited the DNS cache to prevent it from becoming a memory leak if the
   application is left open for a long time on a busy networking computer.
 - Implemented a few other small fixes.
 - Implemented some additional defence in depth measures to make security
   vulnerabilities less likely.


netactview 0.6.3
--------------
    - Updated the location of the Wiki documentation to:
      http://netactview.sourceforge.net/wiki/
      The old wiki address will not be available after 2014-06-19 because
      sourceforge.net retires the hosted apps.


netactview 0.6.2
--------------
    - Fixed connections list refresh on 0 connections


netactview 0.6.1
--------------
    - Fixed a network statistics bug visible when using PPPoE connections


netactview 0.6
--------------
    - Added filter operators
    - Added save as CSV
    - Added contextual column copy
    - Added Italian and Russian translations.
    - Added wiki documentation


netactview 0.5.1
-----------------
    - Fixed a bug in window size saving that appeared on XFCE.


netactview 0.5
-----------------
    - Saving window size and state.
    - Added Estonian and Portuguese translations.


netactview 0.4.1
-----------------
    - Fixed a filtering bug. Updated and closed connections were not filtered properly.


netactview 0.4
----------------
    - Added color highlight for new and closed connections
    - Using gnome fixed width font for network statistics


netactview 0.3.1
----------------
    - Fixed closed UDP enpoints status


netactview 0.3
----------------
    - Added filtering.
    - Fixed a suspend/resume bug.


netactview 0.2.2
----------------
    - Fixed a low risk security vulnerability in the restart as root action.
      An application which could already run as a normal user could have intercepted
      that action in order to run as root.
    Edit 2015-03-30: 
    * 'normal user' is here the ubuntu default desktop user which is a sudo 
       administrator
    * this was a privilege authorization avoidance vulnerability (as in UAC 
      avoidance, but with a distinct user root that actually owns the 
      administrative tasks and effects)
    * it may not be a vulnerability if gksu (used by 'restart as root') is not 
      meant as an UAC alternative; still weak, in case gksu or its replacements 
      are updated to be clearly an UAC (User Account Control) alternative


netactview 0.2.1
----------------
    - Fixed incorrect process name display. On some occasions, for not 
      established connections, the shown process was not the process that 
      created the connection.
    - Improved error checking at program start.


netactview 0.2
--------------
    - Added port service names
    - Added basic network statistics: bytes sent, bytes received
    - Added restart as root
    - Rounded up some of the existing features


netactview 0.1
--------------
    This is the first Net Activity Viewer version.
    
    * It includes all the basic stuff:
        - obtains the list of active network connections (tcp, udp, tcp6, udp6)
          from the kernel.
        - obtains process information for the active network connections (pid, 
          name, command)
        - host name retrieval
        - automatic refresh
        - sorting
        - some information filtering
        - copy and save facilities
        - automatic options state save and restore
